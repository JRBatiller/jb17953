Simulate the nonlinear Duffing equation u¨+2ξ u˙+u+u
3 = Γsin(ωt) for ξ = 0.05, Γ = 0.2 and 0.5 ≤
ω ≤ 1.5.
• What behaviour do you see in the long-time limit?
• Isolate a periodic orbit. What are its starting conditions? What is its period?

• This will provide testing data for your numerical methods.
– Always test your code against known results or you will come unstuck!

"""
Write a general collocation code to enable a user to easily solve periodic boundary
value problems. Take as input
1. an arbitrary ordinary differential equation (in first-order form),
2. the parameters of ODE, and
3. a guess at the state variables over a whole period.
The code should try to solve the differential equation with periodic boundary
conditions (i.e., u(0) = u(T)) and return the corrected state variables over a
whole period.

1. Write a function that constructs a Chebyshev differentiation matrix and
ensure that it passes the specified tests.
• Specifically, use Chebyshev points of the second kind.
• You can use the Matlab code on Blackboard as a starting point or
equations (4.2) and (5.4) from “Barycentric Lagrange Interpolation”
by Berrut and Trefethen, SIAM Review 2004. What are the pros and
cons of either starting point?
• (You could also use the standard definition of Lagrange polynomials
if so desired; again what are the pros and cons?)

Extensions
How might your code be extended to other types of discretisation? Instead
of using Chebyshev polynomials, other types of polynomials and basis
functions can be used (e.g., Hermite polynomials or Fourier series). See
[http://appliedmaths.sun.ac.za/~weideman/research/differ.html] and “A
MATLAB differentiation matrix suite” by Weideman and Reddy, ACM
Transactions on Mathematical Software, 2000.
